## Project's Purpose or Goal: (What will it do for users?)
#### A website that will provide users with information about alternate guitar tunings and songs and artists associated with these tunings. Users will be able to view information about a specific tuning, including chord diagrams, and access links to songs and artists using the tuning. Links to guitar tabs/chord charts and song videos will also be accesible.

## List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:
#### - Many to many relationships between tunings, artists, and songs. 
#### - Search bar functionality is essential as there will be many objects, a list for each model is not going to be very user friendly.
#### - Ability to upload images for tunings 
#### - A navbar with links to each model. 
#### - Identity functionality to allow registered users full CRUD. 
#### - Chord diagrams for each tuning (min 10) and content, lots of it (songs).
