## ASP.NET Core MVC - Save and Display Image/Photo From Database (SQL Server) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZkoeNNjpmA
#### Some unfamiliar concepts but overall project structure is similar and I think it shouldn't be too hard to add images to DB upon object creation. This tutorial also includes some functionality I don't need such as viewing the image in a thumbnail before saving. Still need more clarification though on how I'm going to accomplish this.
