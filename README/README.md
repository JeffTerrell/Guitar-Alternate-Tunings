## ASP.NET Core MVC - Save and Display Image/Photo From Database (SQL Server) 
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZkoeNNjpmA

#### Some unfamiliar concepts but overall project structure is similar and I think it shouldn't be too hard to add images to DB upon object creation. This tutorial also includes some functionality I don't need such as viewing the image in a thumbnail before saving. Still need more clarification though on how I'm going to accomplish this.

#### This tutorial is more in line with what I want to accomplish. I've got a better idea of how to implement picture uploads from object creation. Also, I don't anticipate having any issues displaying images from the DB as this should (fingers crossed) be straightforward.
