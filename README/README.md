## ASP.NET Core MVC - Save and Display Image/Photo From Database (SQL Server) 
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZkoeNNjpmA

#### Some unfamiliar concepts but overall project structure is similar and I think it shouldn't be too hard to add images to DB upon object creation. This tutorial also includes some functionality I don't need such as viewing the image in a thumbnail before saving. Still need more clarification though on how I'm going to accomplish this.

## Asp.Net Core MVC Image Upload and Retrieve
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpJvqiHl1Fo

#### This tutorial is more in line with what I want to accomplish. I've got a better idea of how to implement picture uploads from object creation. Also, I don't anticipate having any issues displaying images from the DB as this should (fingers crossed) be straightforward.

## How to record guitar

#### Looking into recording my audio samples for tunings and associated chords but there are some extra costs so this will likely end up being a future implementation unless I can find samples on the web or an API.

## Alternate Guitar Tunings A Fresh New Sound

#### Found some audio samples here but not exactly what I need. After searching for a while for samples that I can download or an API I have found nothing. The audio sample feature will have to be a future implementaion to the site.

## Web Audio API
## https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API

#### Looked into this API for potentially creating the audio samples digitally, and although it seems it may be possible, I think exploring this route is out of scope for the project and I should spend my time elsewhere.
